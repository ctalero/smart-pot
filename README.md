The files needed for the project to work are the "ssd1306.py" which is the library that controls the oled screen, and the "main.py" file which has all the principal functions of the whole circuit.

The typical problems one might experience while running the code is:
1°- The Dht11 module is not connected properly.
2°- The Oled Screen is not connected properly.
3°- The ssid and the password weren't being declared properly.
